# go-denary64

Package **denary64** provides a **base-10 floating point number** type, for the Go programming language.

Base-10 floating point numbers are safe to use to store **money** values, and are safe to do math calculations with on **money** values.

This is as opposed to the built-in Golang types `float32`, and `float64` which are _base-2_ floating point number types (rather than base-10) and which are **NOT** safe to use for money values.
