# go-denary64

Package **denary64** provides base-10 floating point numbers, for the Go programming languag.

Base-10 floating point numbers are safe to use to store **money** values, and are safe to do math calculations with on **money** values.

This is as opposed to the built-in Golang types float32, and float64 which are base-2 floating point number types (rather than base-10) and which are NOT safe to use for money values.
