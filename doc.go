/*
Package denary64 provides a base-10 floating point number type.

Base-10 floating point numbers are safe to use to store money values, and are safe to do math calculations with on money values.

This is as opposed to the built-in Golang types float32, and float64 which are base-2 floating point number types (rather than base-10) and which are NOT safe to use for money values.
